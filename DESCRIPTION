Description: This package provides methods to use bootstrap resampling to
    quantify uncertainty in fitting ToxCast concentration response data. Each
    experimentally measured curve is resampled. Data is stored in memory,
    written to file, or stored in mysql or mongodb databases. Functions for
    reading the data and analyzing the output are included.
